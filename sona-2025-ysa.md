### 1. Keypoints I found interesting
* Kaya na raw natin ang PHP 20 na bigas nang hindi nalulugi ang mga magsasaka
* Unti-unti nang ipapasok ang Tech-Voc sa senior high school, kaya pwedeng magtrabaho agad pagkatapos ng SHS.
* Tinuloy na ang zero balance billing; Wala nang babayaran ang mga pasyente.
* Hahabulin at pananagutin ang mga utak at sangkot sa mga nawawalang sabungero.
### 2. Keypoints I found weird
* "Higit 1 milyong bahay raw ang magkakaroon ng kuryente sa 2028." I found this weird because it shouldn’t still be a problem—electricity is crucial in this day and age. Everyone should already have access to electricity.
* "Salain ang tubig baha para mainom." You can’t just sieve floodwater. Even if you remove the solid stuff mixed in, it’s still dirty water and could cause diseases to those who drink it.
### 3. Reflection
* While I was watching SONA 2025, I realized that there are still so many things that need to be fixed in the Philippines. Some of these issues mentioned shouldn't even be problems in the first place—like free open-heart surgery from PhilHealth. That should've been available to Filipinos from the start, since PhilHealth is supposed to serve the people. I also noticed that BBM wasn’t as bad as I thought; it really seemed like he thought of these solutions himself, especially since he wasn’t reading from a script—he was speaking from his mind and heart.

* What also stood out to me was how divided our government still is. The absence of VP Sara, Sen. Robin, Sen. Bato, and Sen. Go made it seem like they were doing their own thing, separate from the rest of the administration—which isn’t good for our country. But I liked how the president addressed a wide range of problems in agriculture, education, economy, mental health, labor, and the military. It showed that he’s aware of our struggles and has solutions. I just really hope he follows through and that these aren’t just empty promises.
### 4. Message for the Philippines after SONA 2025
* **Next election, please vote for leaders who can stay united for their whole term—not just during campaign season.**
